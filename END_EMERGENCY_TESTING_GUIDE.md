# End Emergency Feature - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

The "End Emergency" feature has been successfully implemented with the following changes:

### Backend Changes:

1. **Updated Notification Model** (`models.py`):

   - Added `trip_id` field to store ongoing trip ID
   - Made `req_id` optional (nullable) to handle emergency end requests
   - Updated status values to include "confirmed" and "cancelled"

2. **WebSocket Handlers** (`api.py`):

   - `end-emergency-request`: Driver requests to end emergency, creates notification for rider
   - `end-emergency-confirmed`: Rider confirms, marks trip as completed
   - `end-emergency-cancelled`: Rider cancels, driver notified

3. **Database Migration**:
   - Created fresh database with updated schema
   - All tables created successfully with `trip_id` column in notification table

### Frontend Changes:

1. **OngoingTrip Component** (`OngoingTrip.jsx`):

   - Driver clicks "End Emergency" sends WebSocket message to rider
   - Message includes trip_id, rider_id, driver_id, and trip details

2. **Notification Component** (`Notification.jsx`):

   - Added support for `end_emergency_request` notification type
   - New UI with OK/Cancel buttons for rider
   - Event handlers for confirmation and cancellation
   - Real-time WebSocket event listeners

3. **WebSocket Handler** (`handler.js`):
   - Three new message handlers for end-emergency flow
   - Dispatches custom events to update UI

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Prerequisites:

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd FastAPI-demo
   python api.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd rapid_rescue
   npm start
   ```

3. Have two browser windows ready:
   - **Window 1**: Logged in as Driver
   - **Window 2**: Logged in as Rider

### Test Scenario:

#### Step 1: Create an Ongoing Trip

1. In **Rider window**: Create a trip request
2. In **Driver window**: Accept the trip and confirm
3. Both should navigate to the ongoing trip page

#### Step 2: Driver Requests to End Emergency

1. In **Driver window** on the ongoing trip page:

   - Click the "End Emergency" button in the header
   - You should see an alert: "Request sent to rider for confirmation to end emergency"

2. Check **browser console** in driver window for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ End emergency request sent to rider for confirmation
   ```

#### Step 3: Check Backend Logs

In your terminal running the backend, you should see:

```
üöë End emergency request from driver: <driver_id> -> rider: <rider_id>
‚úÖ Found req_id: <req_id> for trip_id: <trip_id>
üíæ Inserting notification into database...
   - Recipient: <rider_id> (rider)
   - Sender: <driver_id> (driver)
   - Type: end_emergency_request
   - Trip ID: <trip_id>
‚úÖ Notification successfully inserted into database with ID: <notification_id>
```

#### Step 4: Rider Receives Notification

1. In **Rider window**:

   - Click the notification bell icon (üîî) in the header
   - You should see a notification with:
     - Yellow warning banner
     - Message: "üöë Driver wants to end the emergency"
     - Two buttons: "OK - End Emergency" and "Cancel"

2. Check **browser console** in rider window for:
   ```
   üîî End emergency request event received: {...}
   üîî Notification.jsx - Fetching notifications for rider: <rider_id>
   üîî Notification.jsx - Total notifications received: 1
   ```

#### Step 5: Test OK Button (Confirm)

1. In **Rider window**: Click "OK - End Emergency" button

2. **Rider** should:

   - See the notification disappear
   - Be redirected to rider dashboard

3. **Driver** should:

   - See an alert: "Rider confirmed. Emergency trip ended successfully."
   - Be redirected to driver dashboard

4. Check database:
   - OngoingTrip status should be "completed"
   - Notification status should be "confirmed"

#### Step 6: Test Cancel Button (Alternative)

1. Repeat Steps 1-4 to create another trip
2. In **Rider window**: Click "Cancel" button instead

3. **Rider** should:

   - See the notification disappear
   - Stay on the ongoing trip page

4. **Driver** should:
   - See an alert: "Rider cancelled the end emergency request. Trip continues."
   - Stay on the ongoing trip page

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Issue: No notification appearing for rider

#### Check 1: Backend Logs

Look for these messages in your terminal:

```
‚úÖ Notification successfully inserted into database with ID: <notification_id>
```

If you DON'T see this, the notification is not being created. Check:

- Is the backend server running?
- Are there any errors in the backend logs?

#### Check 2: Frontend WebSocket Connection

Open browser console (F12) and check for:

```
‚úÖ WebSocket reconnected successfully
```

or

```
‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket not connected
```

If not connected:

- Refresh the page
- Check if the backend WebSocket endpoint is running
- Look for connection errors in console

#### Check 3: Notification API Call

In browser console, look for:

```
üîî Notification.jsx - Fetching notifications for rider: <rider_id>
üîî Notification.jsx - API response: {success: true, data: {...}}
üîî Notification.jsx - Total notifications received: <count>
```

If count is 0:

- Check if notification was created in database
- Check if filtering logic is excluding it

#### Check 4: Database Inspection

Run this SQL query to check if notification was created:

```sql
SELECT * FROM notification
WHERE notification_type = 'end_emergency_request'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Check 5: Console Logging

Add these debug lines to see notification processing:

In `Notification.jsx` around line 50:

```javascript
console.log("üîç All notifications from API:", result.data.notifications);
console.log("üîç Filtered notifications:", filteredNotifications);
```

### Common Issues:

1. **Notification created but not showing**:

   - Check filtering logic in lines 79-97 of `Notification.jsx`
   - Ensure `notification_type === "end_emergency_request"` is included
   - Check if status is being filtered out

2. **WebSocket message not received**:

   - Ensure rider_id in the message matches the logged-in rider
   - Check WebSocket connection status
   - Verify backend is sending to correct user_id

3. **trip_id is null**:
   - Ensure OngoingTrip component is passing `trip_id` in the request
   - Check Redux state for `ongoingTrip.trip_id`

## üìä Expected Flow

```
Driver clicks "End Emergency"
    ‚Üì
OngoingTrip.jsx sends WebSocket message
    ‚Üì
Backend receives "end-emergency-request"
    ‚Üì
Backend creates notification in database
    ‚Üì
Backend sends WebSocket message to rider
    ‚Üì
Frontend handler.js receives message
    ‚Üì
Dispatches "endEmergencyRequestReceived" event
    ‚Üì
Notification.jsx event listener triggers
    ‚Üì
Creates synthetic notification (immediate)
    ‚Üì
Fetches notifications from database
    ‚Üì
Displays notification with OK/Cancel buttons
    ‚Üì
Rider clicks OK or Cancel
    ‚Üì
Sends confirmation/cancellation via WebSocket
    ‚Üì
Backend processes response
    ‚Üì
Notifies driver
    ‚Üì
Both parties navigate appropriately
```

## üîß Quick Fixes

### If notifications still not appearing:

1. **Restart backend server** (Ctrl+C, then `python api.py`)
2. **Refresh both browser windows** (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Clear browser cache** and reload
4. **Check WebSocket connection** in Network tab (WS filter)
5. **Enable verbose logging** in both frontend and backend

### Manual Database Check:

```python
# In Python console
from db import SessionLocal
from models import Notification

session = SessionLocal()
notifications = session.query(Notification).filter(
    Notification.notification_type == 'end_emergency_request'
).all()

for notif in notifications:
    print(f"ID: {notif.notification_id}")
    print(f"Type: {notif.notification_type}")
    print(f"Trip ID: {notif.trip_id}")
    print(f"Recipient: {notif.recipient_id}")
    print(f"Status: {notif.status}")
    print("---")
```

## üìù Notes

- Notifications are polled every 5 seconds when notification panel is open
- WebSocket provides real-time delivery, database ensures persistence
- If WebSocket fails, notification will still be in database for next poll
- Driver must wait for rider confirmation before trip ends
- If rider doesn't respond, driver can contact them directly

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The feature is working correctly if:

1. Driver sees confirmation alert after clicking "End Emergency"
2. Rider receives notification with OK/Cancel buttons
3. Clicking OK ends trip for both parties
4. Clicking Cancel keeps trip active
5. Database records are updated appropriately
6. Both parties navigate to correct pages
